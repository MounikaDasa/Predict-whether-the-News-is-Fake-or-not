# Predict-whether-the-News-is-Fake-or-not

The project is about developing a fake news detection solution using techniques such as RNNs and NLP. Converting text into data and employing methods like LSTM, I aim to predict the authenticity of news. This effort is vital for ensuring accurate media and informed business decisions. I'm utilizing Data Science, TensorFlow 2.0, and deep learning to address the complexities of modern information.
